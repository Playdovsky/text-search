# Text search algorithms
This program executes **Naive**, **Sunday** and **Karp-Rabin** algorithms for the given data.\
Algorithms are then analysed, calculated and drawn onto the charts.\
The graphs are available for three types of data:\
* Text |T| lengths against number of comparisons
* Pattern |W| lengths against number of comparisons
* Alphabet |A| lengths against number of comparisons
